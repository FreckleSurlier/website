    <h1>Breaking Free from Food Prison is the goal.</h1>

    <div class="intro">
        And my evidence-based recovery approach is a powerful tool to help you escape the restrict-binge cycle and food obsession for good.
    </div>

    <p>I teach food freedom. The recovery methods I share are designed to help you achieve specific goals like stopping binge eating, quieting food thoughts, and creating a peaceful relationship with eating. And to help you breathe easier around food and have more potent use of your natural hunger and fullness signals.</p>

    <p>These are neurologically-informed processes. And they help you rewire your relationship with food. I think of them as "recovery through understanding" not just "recovery through restriction" as most programs teach.</p>

    <p>I feel my approach is more grounded in science. You can radically improve your food freedom by bringing awareness to the restrict-binge cycle and engaging in evidence-based recovery practices. True recovery can teach you how to eat easier, freer, and without mental torment.</p>

    <h2>The Truth About Food Obsession That Changes Everything</h2>

    <p>After years trapped in the cycle myself and helping hundreds of others break free, I've learned something that the diet industry doesn't want you to know: <strong>food obsession is not a willpower problem—it's a biological response to restriction.</strong></p>

    <p>When you restrict food, your brain produces more ghrelin (the hunger hormone) and becomes hyper-focused on eating as a survival mechanism. This isn't moral weakness. This is your nervous system doing exactly what it's designed to do when it perceives scarcity.</p>

    <p>The restrict-binge cycle operates like this: Restriction → Increased food thoughts → Eventual "loss of control" eating → Shame → More restriction. Breaking this cycle requires a completely different approach than what most programs teach.</p>

    <h2>Why Everything Else Has Failed You</h2>

    <p><strong>The Willpower Myth:</strong> Every diet or restriction approach strengthens the neural pathways that drive food-seeking behavior. Your brain literally rewires itself to become more obsessed with food each time you restrict.</p>

    <p><strong>The Therapy Gap:</strong> Traditional therapy, while valuable, often doesn't address the biological component of food obsession. You can understand your emotions perfectly and still be driven by restrictive thinking patterns.</p>

    <p><strong>The Moderation Trap:</strong> For someone caught in the restrict-binge cycle, "moderation" feels impossible because restriction of any kind triggers the survival response that leads to food obsession.</p>

    <h2>What Real Food Freedom Looks Like</h2>

    <div class="testimonial">
        "After 15 years of dieting and binge eating, I finally understand what normal eating feels like. I don't think about food constantly anymore. I can eat lunch and not worry about dinner. I sleep peacefully instead of planning tomorrow's 'perfect' eating day. This approach saved my life."
        <br><strong>– Sarah, 18 months into recovery</strong>
    </div>

    <p><strong>Real recovery means:</strong></p>

    <ul>
        <li>Complete mental quiet around food—no more planning, obsessing, or food anxiety</li>
        <li>Natural appetite regulation—your body's signals work normally again</li>
        <li>Food neutrality—you can be around any food without internal struggle</li>
        <li>Social freedom—parties and restaurants become enjoyable instead of stressful</li>
        <li>Energy for life—your mental space is freed up for relationships, work, and joy</li>
        <li>Body trust—you can eat when hungry and stop when satisfied without rules</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>My Recovery Approach: Science-Based Food Freedom</h2>

    <p>Drawing from eating disorder research, neuroscience, and trauma-informed care, my approach addresses what I call the three pillars of lasting food freedom:</p>

    <h3>Foundation 1: Neurological Healing</h3>
    <p>• Understanding how restriction rewires your brain for food obsession<br>
    • Learning to work with your nervous system instead of against it<br>
    • Restoring natural appetite regulation through adequate nourishment<br>
    • Breaking the restrict-binge cycle at the biological level</p>

    <h3>Foundation 2: Psychological Liberation</h3>
    <p>• Addressing the underlying emotional patterns that drive restrictive thinking<br>
    • Healing the shame and self-attack that maintains disordered eating<br>
    • Developing a compassionate relationship with yourself around food<br>
    • Processing any trauma that may be connected to your food struggles</p>

    <h3>Foundation 3: Practical Integration</h3>
    <p>• Learning how to eat adequately without rules or restriction<br>
    • Navigating social situations with confidence and ease<br>
    • Building long-term practices that support lasting food freedom<br>
    • Creating a life where food plays its natural, uncomplicated role</p>

    <h2>Who This Approach Helps</h2>

    <p>This work is specifically for people who:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Experience regular episodes of eating that feels out of control</li>
        <li>Have persistent thoughts about food that interfere with daily life</li>
        <li>Feel trapped in cycles of restriction followed by overeating</li>
        <li>Have tried multiple diets, programs, or approaches without lasting success</li>
        <li>Use food to cope with emotions, stress, or difficult feelings</li>
        <li>Feel shame or secrecy around their eating patterns</li>
        <li>Are ready to address this as a recovery issue rather than a willpower problem</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h4>Is this another diet or eating plan?</h4>
        <p>No. This is the opposite of a diet. Recovery means learning to eat adequately and consistently without rules, restrictions, or food anxiety. Dieting and restriction are what create food obsession in the first place.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <h4>Will I gain weight if I stop restricting?</h4>
        <p>Some people gain weight initially as their body heals from restriction, while others maintain or even lose weight as the binge episodes stop. The goal is reaching your body's natural, healthy weight—which you can't determine while caught in restrict-binge cycles.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <h4>How long does recovery take?</h4>
        <p>Most people notice significant changes in food thoughts within 2-6 months of consistent recovery work. Full food freedom—where eating feels completely natural and unconflicted—typically develops over 1-2 years.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <h4>Can this help with emotional eating?</h4>
        <p>Yes. What many people call "emotional eating" is often actually biology—your body trying to get adequate nutrition while you're restricting. When you eat enough consistently, emotional eating naturally decreases.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 id="contact">Ready to Begin?</h2>

    <p>If you're tired of fighting with food and ready to discover what peaceful eating actually feels like, this work can help. Food freedom isn't just possible—it's your natural state. The obsession, anxiety, and constant mental battle with eating aren't who you really are.</p>

    <p>Recovery happens one meal, one day, one choice at a time. And it starts with understanding that you're not broken—you're responding normally to restriction.</p>

            <div class="comment-author">Emma</div>
            <p>This approach completely changed my relationship with food. After 20 years of dieting, I finally understand why I couldn't stop binge eating. The science-based explanation made everything click. Now I eat when I'm hungry, stop when I'm full, and don't think about food between meals. It feels like magic, but it's actually just normal eating.</p>
        </div>

            <div class="comment-author">Michael</div>
            <p>I was skeptical at first—how could eating MORE help me with binge eating? But the explanation about restriction and brain chemistry made sense. Within a few months, the constant food thoughts just... stopped. I can't remember the last time I binged. This is the freedom I was looking for all along.</p>

            <p>As a physician, I appreciate the evidence-based approach here. The neuroscience research on restriction and food obsession is solid, but most treatment providers still don't understand it. This work fills a crucial gap in eating disorder recovery.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="comment">
            <div class="comment-author">Lisa</div>
            <p>The part about food obsession being a response to restriction was life-changing for me. I thought I was addicted to food, but really I was just chronically underfed. Once I started eating enough consistently, the "addiction" disappeared. Two years later, I have complete food freedom.</p>
