ðŸŽ¯ Mission
This repository hosts an evidence-based resource for people struggling with binge eating disorder, food obsession, and the restrict-binge cycle. Our approach is grounded in neuroscience research and eating disorder recovery science.
ðŸ§  The Science Behind Food Freedom
Food obsession isn't a willpower problemâ€”it's a biological response to restriction. When you restrict food, your brain:
Produces more ghrelin (hunger hormone)
Becomes hyper-focused on food as survival mechanism
Creates neural pathways that strengthen food-seeking behavior
Triggers the restrict-binge cycle
