# Food Freedom Coaching & Courses Website

This is the source code for the [Food Freedom Coaching & Courses](https://frecklesurlier.github.io/website/) website. Inspired by Ryan Nagy's minimalist, story-first style, this site uses clean navigation and narrative content to help people break free from binge eating and food obsession.

## Features

- Minimalist, distraction-free design
- Three main pages (`index.html`, `about.html`, `sessions.html`)
- SEO-optimized structure and content
- Responsive, Georgia-serif typography
- Open for further personalization

## Getting Started

1. **Clone or fork** this repository.
2. **Edit content** for your own story, program, or links.
3. **Push changes** to the `main` branch.
4. Your site will be live at <https://frecklesurlier.github.io/website/> (if GitHub Pages is enabled).

All styles are in the `style.css` file. You can create more pages (e.g., privacy, terms) by duplicating the templates.
